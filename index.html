            <h4 class="advantages-title">Increase your cart value</h4>
            <p class="advantages-p">Personalized product recommendation is like a virtual salesperson for your online store: it learns what your customers need, suggests the right products accordingly, and offers useful complementary items. As a result, shoppers will add more to their carts, increasing your average order value and helping you maximize your sales growth.</p>
          </div>

            <h4 class="advantages-title">Reduce shipping costs & optimize your inventory</h4>
            <p class="advantages-p">When you increase the amount that each visitor purchases, you’ll see more than an immediate increase in sales. You will also reduce your shipping and handling costs, increasing your overall profitability in the long run. Delivering more items at once allows you to save on shipping fees, office supplies and shipping materials, as well as avoid hidden costs such as the time spent processing each order and scheduling reorder intervals.</p>

            <p class="advantages-p">Customized product recommendation can boost your sales and it can also build your brand, improving customer satisfaction and loyalty. You can save your customers money by passing on the reduced shipping costs from shipping and handling, and save their time by recommending all the products they need – right when they need them.</p>
