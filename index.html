            <h4>Reduce shipping costs & optimize your inventory</h4>
            <p>When you increase the amount that each visitor purchases, you’ll see more than an immediate increase in sales. You will also reduce your shipping and handling costs, increasing your overall profitability in the long run. Delivering more items at once allows you to save on shipping fees, office supplies and shipping materials, as well as avoid hidden costs such as the time spent processing each order and scheduling reorder intervals.</p>
